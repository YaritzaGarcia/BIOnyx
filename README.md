# **BIOnyx**


## **Introduction**

  The basic structure of life is just composed of a single sequence that re arranges over and over to create life as we know it. Known as DNA and RNA the sequences of life. “ACGT” are the four letters that stand for the nucleobases that define the genetics of every living creature on earth. Structural Biology is the science that studies how these molecules are build. By using different technologies, they model molecules and proteins, to help the research in many medical areas. This area of study of structural biology that uses software to model molecules is know as computation biology. Even with all our technological advances computational biology specifically molecular dynamics still a rather complicated task to do, there is no straightforward programing language that let computational biology users access data and perform structural analysis in a simple and efficient way. This is the reason behind the creation of **BIOnyx**, a programing language that will allow computational biology users model, analyze, and access data for any biological system. **BIOnyx** will reduce the amount of time computational biology users spend learning a complex language and the amount of time the nowadays solutions take to code. **BIOnyx** will be a very simplistic, high level and functional programing language. We aim to facilitate the molecular dynamics process and find a more time and memory efficient way to do these processes. Helping researchers and computational biologist focus on what really matters. (“Structural biology”)

Some of the potential advantages of our programming language would be:

* Facilitate the access to data for computational biologists
* Simplify the actual molecular dynamic process
* Improve the overall molecular modeling code efficiency
* A fastest and shorter coding redaction experience.
* Simplistic coding structures.
* A more understandable and high-level syntax.


## **Features**

  BIOnyx will be a high-level programming language that will provide the computational biologists tools that will allow them to access data from the PDB (Protein Data Bank), modeling molecular structures, running structural biology analysis, and run molecular dynamics process.  Users will also be able to modify many of the molecule’s properties like their velocity and temperature, so researchers can test the behaviors of these under different environments. Some of the main features of the language will be:
* PDB Access 
* Molecular Modeling
* Structural Biology analysis

## **Features Currently Working**

  * Simple mathematical opertations such as addition, substraction, multiplication and division. 
  * Values can be stored in variables. (Example of values: Strings, Dictionaries, Mathematical Operations)
  * Functions:
    * getFile - Given the identifier of a protein and a path, this function will find the protein in a pdb file already loaded into our programm and store it in the    given path. This function makes it easier to locate the proteins information.
    * getPolypeptides - Given a the identifier of a protein, this function returns a table with all of the given proteins polypeptides.
    * getAminoAcidsInfo - Given the identifier of a protein, this funtion returns a table of the amino acids each polypeptide contains of the given protein.
    * MolecularWeight - Calculates the molecular weight of the given protein.
